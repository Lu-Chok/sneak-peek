# Sneak Peek
Non-distractive way to take a quick look at you social media.
App will be automatically closed after a set timeout, no more screentime and self-delusion.

# How to use:
1. Run `setup-sneak-peak.sh` using this command
```bash
sh setup-sneak-peak.sh
```
2. Drag and drop your app from application folder to terminal when requested
3. Provide a timeout in seconds, 45 or 60 seconds works best
4. Optional: Put your sneak-peek version of app in dock instead of normal app
